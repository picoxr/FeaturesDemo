# FeaturesDemo

The PICO Features Demo springs from the need to have an in-house PICO demo that can show the device's most advanced features while maintaining a slow and friendly enough pace for VR newcomers.
This demo is conceived as a story-driven application that requires little to no guidance from the PICO promoter, giving complete freedom to the user to experiment with the headset in a controlled environment.
The story will embark users on a journey through PICO 4 Enterprise's different features. They will learn about the different hardware and software specifications in an immersive experience, interacting with different virtual elements and sparking the interest of new and skilled VR users on Pico products.

### Controller interactions:
- Grip button: ray/direct grabbing, activate the physical button
- Grip button: UI interactions (click)
### Enabling hand tracking
Take the controllers from the user, place them on a flat surface (they must be still) and advise the user to extend their arms and put their hands in front of the headset so they're easily recognizable.
Users can play around with hand tracking - if they perform the "pinch" gesture, they will be able to control some objects on the table (cubes, seethrough tablet, notepad) by making them levitate.
### Face/Eye tracking
The mirror will reflect the user's avatar, showing the face and eye tracking capabilities of the headset. 
Tip: encourage the user to test different facial expressions, smile, laugh, or even stick out their tongue.
Notice: users wearing glasses, with larger noses or beards may experience worse results. This is due to the placement of the tracking cameras (directly above the nose, and under the eyes)
